# ***Welcome to Space Invaders Game!***



## Introduction

Welcome to our space game. This is a web based game. <br>
Our goal is to provide for you an easy way to play our game based on the web, without even downloading it. <br><br>
Get ready to relive the timeless excitement of arcade gaming as you take control of a lone defender standing between humanity and an alien invasion. In this iconic retro game, Space Invaders puts you in the driver's seat of a spaceship, defending Earth from relentless waves of descending extraterrestrial foes. <br>
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to eliminate all the bad spaceships as fast as possible, and to protect yourself and the Earth from these bad spaceShips. <br> 
With each successful shot, you inch closer to victory, but bewareâ€”the invaders' relentless march and ever-increasing speed will test your agility and aim. Prepare for a journey back in time as you experience the nostalgia and challenge of Space Invaders, where the fate of the planet lies in your hands and your trigger finger!<br>
Good Luck! ...
